Version

Tech
-----------

Matinee is built using:

* [Angular.js] 
* [Bootstrap]

Installation
--------------

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/johnsonjake/Matinee.git
$ cd Matinee/
$ git checkout gh-pages
```

##### Because of the use of relative urls to load resources, you'll have to run this from within a web server. The easiest way to do it is using python 2's SimpleHTTPServer from within the project directory:

```sh
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
